```

## Objectives
Create a web page presentation using R Markdown that features a plot created with Plotly. 

We use the mtcars dataset and plot the relationship of gas mileage (`mpg`) with weight (`wt`) of cars.


The number of cylinders (`cyl`) is shown as colors in dots and the amount of horsepower (`hp`) as the size of each point in the plot.


## Cars: Mileage VS Weight 

```{r plot, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(plotly))

plot_ly(data = mtcars, x = ~wt, y = ~mpg, 
        color = ~as.factor(cyl), size = ~hp,
        text = ~paste("Weight: ", wt, 'MPG:', mpg),
        type = "scatter", mode = "markers") %>%
  layout(title = "Car Consumption")
```
